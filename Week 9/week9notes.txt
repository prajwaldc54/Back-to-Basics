1) Into OOP we get to see what a class is and what the objects are, basically how a class is a blueprint of how things are allinged and object is something 
   that we have on it. 
2) More into classes and structs basically bith are kinda similar only thing differntiating them is the access modifier present on both of them, while class
   two types of access modifiers private and public, whereas struct onlly has one that is public. Both have PODS in them. 
3) We can start struct and class with Uppercase and also accessing data from private access provider is done using a function.

1) Into OOP we get to see what a class is and what the objects are, basically how a class is a blueprint of how things are allinged and object is something 
   that we have on it. 
2) More into classes and structs basically bith are kinda similar only thing differntiating them is the access modifier present on both of them, while class
   two types of access modifiers private and public, whereas struct onlly has one that is public. Both have PODS in them. 
3) We can start struct and class with Uppercase and also accessing data from private access provider is done using a function.
4) More into OOP class, object, constructor and static members. As defined earlier class is a blueprint of things to come where object is the instance of the 
   class, constructor is a specialized function  where it has types default constructor adn parameterized constructor and lastly talking about static members
   they are memebers that which is shared acrros every memebers.
5) A look in OOP concept encapsulation where how data memebers are hidden and how can that be achieved in c++. Firstly usiing access modifiers is a good practice of 
   encapsulation and also using getters() and setters() method. With this practice we can have our data safe and secure.

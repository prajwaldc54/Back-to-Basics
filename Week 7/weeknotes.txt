1) Into multi-dimensional arrays and nested vectors and loops to print the multi-dimensonal arrays.
2) Use of nested vectors is: vector <vector <int>> vec.
3) Something on const why is it important and when to use it, basically what it does is keep the integrity of the data making it 
   unchangable. 
4) Passing by value and passing by reference both are methods used to pass the values in or from the function, acoording to my
   understanding pass by value takes up more space creating a duplicate memory space as well where as pass by reference is a 
   more effective way where it uses less memory and changes done is done globally and if we add const to the referncing then
   it would be more secure and effective.
5) Function overloading means using the same function name with different parameter name and type and also in "C++" particularly
   it doesnt depend onreturn type meaning if we use different return type it is not called function overloading. 
6) As stated function overloading is applicable for different parameter types names but not on different return type and for default
   arguments it might be ambigious so watch out for it. 
7) Onto Multifile compilation have a header file, function definition file (implementation file) and a main file using these file
   compilation we can perform a clear and consise code writing. Some things to be wary of is using IFNDEF and endif at the header
   file and also including the header file in both the implementation and main file. 
8) Using a flag "-c" gives us the object of the files that way we can use that and make out libraries and code hidden.
9) Working with makefiles helps to execute all file at once, creating a final executable file at the end, 
10) Using namespace avoids naming conflict its good to understand but we can implement various funtions with out it for better
   practice.

1) Into multi-dimensional arrays and nested vectors and loops to print the multi-dimensonal arrays.
2) Use of nested vectors is: vector <vector <int>> vec.
3) Something on const why is it important and when to use it, basically what it does is keep the integrity of the data making it 
   unchangable. 
4) Passing by value and passing by reference both are methods used to pass the values in or from the function, acoording to my
   understanding pass by value takes up more space creating a duplicate memory space as well where as pass by reference is a 
   more effective way where it uses less memory and changes done is done globally and if we add const to the referncing then
   it would be more secure and effective.

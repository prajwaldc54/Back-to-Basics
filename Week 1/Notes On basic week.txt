1) Manipulators: endl.
 
2) Object: cin, cout.

3) Naming Conventions and core c++ guidelines on this link: https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines.

4) Name of a name is known as an identifier.

5) Function easier to write a reusable code.

6) My confusion part parameters and arguments so i get it now, parameters when defining the function and argumments when calling them.

7) Three parts of Function creation Declaration, Definition and calling, most casses declaration and defination go hand in hand and one thing to notice is that we can also declare function just like variables.

8) Including math functions use "#include <cmath>".  

9) Something to add on point 7 while declaration we dont need to give variable names just DATATYPES.

10) Void function probably doesnt return anything on my initial understanding it is used to clean the main and as shown in my my program this void function only does one thing.

11) the new line endl instead we can use the standard /n inside this " ". 

12) C++ is a static type programming language basically whatever you give the variable type it stays with it till the compile time.

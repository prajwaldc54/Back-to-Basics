1) Conditional flow and use of if basic stuff and use of return -1 
2) Working with switch makes us more conciouss on what enum is and how we use enums and enum class in switch conditions.
3) Use of string in integer type and char type is common we get to find out that switch isnt compatible with string type.
4) Used enums and enum class in switch for better understanding how it is compatible with switch and better understanding
   of class scope while using enum class.
5) Pros and cons of using enums and enums class and the role that scope plays is quite important.
6) Into the loops basic three loop types : for, while and do while.
7) The ICU pattern which is initialization, condition and update both while and for loop follow this pattern where as do while
   at least prints something first. 
8) Inside of the curly brackets after do are where we keep the type of code we want to generate it frequently and while is the
   part where comparison happens and we should also keep the scope in mind.
9) Break and Continue are the key factors to alter the flow of loop, as the name suggests break is used to stop and exit a loop
   when a certain condition is meet or fullfilled. While continue is used to skip that part if the condition is meet.

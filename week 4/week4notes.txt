1) Conditional flow and use of if basic stuff and use of return -1 
2) Working with switch makes us more conciouss on what enum is and how we use enums and enum class in switch conditions.

4) Used enums and enum class in switch for better understanding how it is compatible with switch and better understanding
   of class scope while using enum class.

1) Conditional flow and use of if basic stuff and use of return -1 
2) Working with switch makes us more conciouss on what enum is and how we use enums and enum class in switch conditions.
3) Use of string in integer type and char type is common we get to find out that switch isnt compatible with string type.
4) Used enums and enum class in switch for better understanding how it is compatible with switch and better understanding
   of class scope while using enum class.
5) Pros and cons of using enums and enums class and the role that scope plays is quite important.
6) Into the loops basic three loop types : for, while and do while.
7) The ICU pattern which is initialization, condition and update both while and for loop follow this pattern where as do while
   at least prints something first.

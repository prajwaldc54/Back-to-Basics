1) Into iostream and how does the program get data from the user, In case of cin or input there is a input stream which gets all the data and puts in a buffer space
   where once hit enter in case of cin gets flushed to the program. 
2) In case of cout before displaying the output the outputs follows a output stream and is kept at buffer "the waiting area" then it gets displayed on the screen.
3) Reading from a user seems preety simple but what about reading files and working with real world data, we use a library fstream which is just like iostream but
   for files.

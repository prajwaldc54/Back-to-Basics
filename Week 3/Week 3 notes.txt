1) Looked into some of the numeric functions from cmath STL library some built in function like pow we used during our week 1.
2) Moving forward we look into strings and string literals and there are two ways to deffine a string in c++ 
   a) Using string class (The best option)
   b) Using c-style string (Array of char)
3) String class uses namespace so obviously use std and we can change as well as has various member functions so we can get its
   length, size and what not. Also in c++ just defining a string means it has an empty space.
4) Input for string is another tricky part using cin only lets user to get input till the white space or the tab but using getinline()
   function is the best way to get input for any string.
